  <p>Interested in problem solving, quizzing and showing off your knowledge in the fields of Mathematics and Physics? The LGP Academic Triathlon is the perfect competition for you! The triathlon will consist of three stages tailored to test different academic skills namely mathematical computation, logical reasoning and estimation and trivia / general knowledge in the field of Physics. Teams of 3 will compete to earn points across the stages and the top three teams on the leaderboard at the end will be awarded the cash prizes!</p>
<h3>Competition Guidelines</h3>
<h4>Integration Bee:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The integration bee aims to challenge participants' mastery of integral calculus and provide a platform for students to showcase their proficiency in solving a variety of integration problems efficiently and accurately. The competition is geared towards students majoring in mathematics, physics, and related fields, as well as anyone with a passion for calculus and problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants will be tested on their ability to apply integration techniques to solve both standard and non-standard integrals. They will also be tested on their ability to demonstrate their mathematical prowess and adaptability under pressure. They will be evaluated based on correctness, efficiency, and clarity of explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The competition will consist of three rounds of increasing difficulties. Participants that perform well in previous rounds will advance to the next, collecting more points. For this competition team members will participate individually.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fermi Bee:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Fermi Bee will test whether participants have what it takes to logically arrive at the closest answer to our questions! This event is aimed at not just people from STEM, but for everyone who has an ability to make a good educated guess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This stage will be judged by PhD students of Ashoka University</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams would be judged on the basis of how accurate their guess is along with the steps and decisions they took to arrive at their answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams would have 10 minutes to arrive at their answer and will be expected to present their answer to their co-competitors' answer judges. They may have to argue and defend their answers as well as analyze where others may have taken incorrect steps. For this competition the entire team will participate and work as one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Physics Cryptic Hunt:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Physics Cryptic Hunt is a fun and challenging competition intended to test students against a range of physics-related questions and concepts, from trivia questions to dimensional analysis puzzles. Each team will race against the others to complete each puzzle and move ahead in levels, with each question being revealed only once the previous one has been solved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The event is aimed at all STEM students, though the questions will all have some physics application or knowledge requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This competition will test the participants on a range of skills- their general knowledge, memorisation of basic physics knowledge, and how quickly they can think through practice problems and novel questions. The cryptic hunt levels will contain questions that the participants might have come across before, as well as new problems and puzzles that test their ability to think on their feet. Though the questions will initially be simple and quick to solve, they will scale in difficulty with the levels, posing new challenges to the teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Physics Cryptic Hunt will consist of around 15 levels. All groups will begin at Level 0, and move upwards by solving the questions as fast as possible. Each question is handed out to the teams on a piece of paper. Teams solve the problem and write down the answer, and get it verified by the Hunt volunteers. If the solution is exactly correct, the volunteer will hand them the next question and they may proceed. A leaderboard listing each teamâ€™s current level will also be maintained on the board. The first team to solve the final problem in the series will be declared the winner. Use of the internet or calculators will not be permitted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
