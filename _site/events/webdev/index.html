  <p>Calling all web wizzes! Put your design and development skills to the test by replicating a given sample website under a time crunch. We’re open to any frameworks you want to use, the only constraint is you have to make everything with code, no UI tools such as Figma or generative AI tools are allowed. We'll be looking for matches in terms of layout, functionality, and responsiveness across all devices. Additional backend features added to improve the website will receive extra points. So sharpen your development skills, and get ready to showcase your website cloning expertise!</p>
<h3>Competition Guidelines</h3>
<p>We’re looking for front-end developers from any batch with strong skills in developing and designing websites, who can not only replicate the look and feel of a website, but also ensure it functions flawlessly across all devices.</p>
<p>This competition will test your ability to pay attention to detail and replicate what you see using code. The main areas that we will test you on is</p>
<ul>
<li>Design: the closeness to the look and feel of the website,</li>
<li>Any extra backend features you have added to improve the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>The competition will be conducted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sample website will be projected to everyone and kept playing on a loop for the first 30 minutes of the competition. Taking any photos or videos will lead to immediate disqualification. The participants will then have access to our laptop to test the website at intervals of 45 minutes, starting from the 2nd hour of the competition.</li>
<li>The entire competition will be for 4 hours, starting from when the website is first presented.</li>
<li>At the end of the competition, the participants will have to submit their code as a GitHub repository. We’re expecting all participants to attach their website host links as well.</li>
<li>Winners will be determined based on the closeness to the sample website and how they have been able to improve its backend functionality without changing the front end much.</li>
</ul>
<p>This competition will be judged by a panel of CS professors at Ashoka.</p>
<h4>Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li>All participants are expected to bring their own laptops.</li>
<li>No photos or videos of the website are allowed. No use of generative AI or UI tools such as Figma is allowed. Participants found in violation of this will be immediately disqualified.</li>
<li>Website access: The website will be on display for the first 30 minutes of the competition, and then laptops will be there to access the website at intervals of 45 minutes each, starting from the 2nd hour of the competition.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Event Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: 30th March 2024</li>
