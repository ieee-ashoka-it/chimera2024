    <h2>Why Chimera?</h2>
    <p><i>chimera</i> [<i>kahy-meer-uh</i>]</p>
    <p>The chimera, in Greek mythology, is a creature composed of parts from different animals, often embodying a fantastical amalgamation of features. The chimera is depicted as a fire-breathing monster with the body of a lion, the head of a goat protruding from its back, and a serpent for a tail. <i>chi·mae·ra</i> [<i>kahy-meer-uh</i>] Just as the chimera embodies a fusion of different animal parts, STEM represents a mix of distinct disciplines, each contributing its unique strengths to create something new and impactful. This interdisciplinary approach fosters innovation, driving progress across a wide range of fields, from medicine to space exploration, echoing the mythical chimera's ability to transcend the boundaries of individual creatures. We celebrate this ideology in IEEE Ashoka and hope to showcase it at Chimera 2024!</p>
