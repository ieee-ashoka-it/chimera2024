Interested in health and high-dimensional data? Here is the competition for you! The objective of this competition is to allow for an interdisciplinary collaboration that allows for efficient inferences drawn from complex health data. The competition encourages developing teams with multiple domains to come together and work to their strengths. Teams may choose one of the two offered tracks in the marathon and take 30 hours to present their critical findings in presentation format to the judges.

### What to expect:
The competition would be based on a health dataset based on electronic health records, including detailed data fields for each patient, including, but not limited to, demographics and the details of each admission episode. 
- Participants would be provided with a dataset along with a detailed description of it, including the headers and some domain-specific context. Some preprocessing pipelines would also be provided as a guide in the form of a Jupyter notebook.
- A scheduled helpdesk will be available for participants to clarify doubts 
- Participants will be given information on exactly what is expected of them (once they have gotten comfortable with the dataset) 
- Participants continue their work and finish the deliverables, submitting their decks
- The top 5 decks are selected and are asked to present their ideas
  - 5 minutes of presentation and upto 10 minutes for rebuttals

### Competition Guidelines
Tracks for the competition (Choose either): 
- **Track 1**: Longitudinal Data Analysis and Inference
  - Participants will engage with longitudinal datasets to extract meaningful patterns and insights. Utilizing longitudinal classification techniques, teams will be tasked with identifying trends, anomalies, or predictive markers within the dataset. The focus will be on creative and insightful analysis, with higher marks awarded for more novel and impactful inferences.
- **Track 2**: Efficient Resource Allocation in Healthcare  
  - This theme revolves around analyzing data related to healthcare resources, including medications and equipment. Participants will explore optimization strategies for resource distribution, aiming to identify potential efficiencies or waste in healthcare settings. Proposals should focus on practical, actionable insights that could lead to improved resource management in real-world healthcare systems.

### Assessment Criteria
A panel of professors and fellows working with the same/similar dataset will be chosen. Assessment would be under the following headings, each marked on a scale of 0-5: 
- Problem Alignment 
- Insights and Impact
- Technical Soundness
- Interdisciplinary Strength 
- Presentation
