Interested in innovation and making a change in the health-technology field? The KCDH-A Healthtech Ideathon is for students exactly like you! All teams will be given a health-related prompt for which they will have to develop a tangible idea of a device (like a blueprint, prototype, etc.) with substantial justification through research and reasoning. Take a shot at winning from a prize pool of 45k INR while also receiving professional guidance along the way! 



### Competition Guidelines
- All registered teams will receive the prompt a few days prior to the competition. 
- Come to the competition with a few ideas that your team is ready to workshop during the ideathon
- All teams will be split into groups with an assigned mentor who is knowledgeable about the field relevant to the prompt
- During the ideathon, the mentors will guide you in researching, developing and refining your idea
- Alongside offering guidance, the mentors will also serve as judges while scoring you for progress being made in the workshopping stage
- At the end of the workshopping stage, the highest scoring teams from each group will face off in a final round of presentations to compete for the top three places in the competition!
