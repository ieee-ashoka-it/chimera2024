### Competition Guidelines
- There will be a written prelim, with 15 questions. The quizmaster will revisit all the questions after presenting the 15th question, to ensure participants get necessary time to catch up if needed.
- Top 6 teams from the prelim qualify for an onstage final
- The final round will also include 15 questions. But, to make it as riveting as possible, the entire round will be on buzzers.
- The questions will be presented one at a time, after which the buzzers will be unlocked.
- Teams will need to buzz to get the chance to answer.
- Scoring will be +100/-50, to maintain high stakes for every question.
- We will keep going in the order of the teams buzzing till a team gets the correct answer, before we open the question up to the audience.
- Top 3 teams in the final win cash prizes from the prize pool!
