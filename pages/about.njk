    <h2>CHIMERA 2024</h2>
    <p>IEEE Ashoka is proud to announce Chimera, an inter-university celebration of excellence in STEM research and innovation. Our objective is to showcase the work of our university's students across STEM fields while providing a vibrant platform for networking and an enjoyable weekend-long experience for all visitors. Chimera is especially unique because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It includes a wide array of disciplines, aligned with IEEE’s overall goal</li>
        <li>It integrates research into the festival, drawing from Ashoka’s rich research-oriented background</li>
        <li>Ashoka’s liberal arts curriculum provides a unique, interdisciplinary background</li>
        <li>It is the first iteration of many to come, bringing Ashoka to the forefront of STEM research in India</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Talks and Workshops</h3>
    <p>Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with professionals and industry leaders through enlightening talks and interactive workshops, gaining valuable insights into cutting-edge developments in the field.</p>

    <h2>Why Chimera?</h2>
    <p><i>chimera</i> [<i>kahy-meer-uh</i>]</p>
    <p>The chimera, in Greek mythology, is a creature composed of parts from different animals, often embodying a fantastical amalgamation of features. The chimera is depicted as a fire-breathing monster with the body of a lion, the head of a goat protruding from its back, and a serpent for a tail. <i>chi·mae·ra</i> [<i>kahy-meer-uh</i>] Just as the chimera embodies a fusion of different animal parts, STEM represents a mix of distinct disciplines, each contributing its unique strengths to create something new and impactful. This interdisciplinary approach fosters innovation, driving progress across a wide range of fields, from medicine to space exploration, echoing the mythical chimera's ability to transcend the boundaries of individual creatures. We celebrate this ideology in IEEE Ashoka and hope to showcase it at Chimera 2024!</p>
