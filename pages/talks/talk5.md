> **Title:** Collaboration of Computer Science with Social Science

> **Abstract:** The collaboration of computer science with other disciplines such as medicine has been particularly fruitful. The next untapped frontier is collaboration of computer science and technology with social science and policy making. The talk will discuss the opportunities, and challenges of such collaborations. It will cover instances of some successful cases of collaboration between computer science and economics, political science, behavioral science and conclude with discussions of some unexplored ways in which the two disciplines can collaborate with each other.
