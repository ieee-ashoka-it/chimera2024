> **Title:** "Sustainability Initiatives and Energy Transition: Promises and Pitfalls

> **Abstract:** The global push for an energy transition away from fossil fuels has generated significant activity in alternatives such as biofuels, electric vehicles, green hydrogen and more.  Policies across the world are stimulating large investments into these areas, and a spectrum of businesses from large corporates to fledgling startups have jumped on to the bandwagon. How will stakeholders - governments, investors, current and future employees of such companies, technologists and citizens at large critically assess what is likely to succeed and what is not?  With resources for development, especially at the bottom of the pyramid, remaining constrained and time potentially running out for the planet to avert climate catastrophe, what approaches can simultaneously deliver both accuracy and speed towards evidence-based, agile and collaborative decision-making?
