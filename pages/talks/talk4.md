> **Title:** The ‘Second’ Quantum Revolution: Prospects & Challenges

> **Abstract:** It has been a challenge to make practical use of some of the wonderfully counterintuitive yet immensely powerful features of the quantum world. Quantum technologies today seek to use quantum phenomena in computing, communication, sensing and metrology to go beyond what classical systems can do. In the exciting context of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, and the recent launch of the National Quantum Mission 2023-31 by the Indian Government, I will give a flavor of these quantum resources, with varied examples of nonclassical states of light and quantum correlations produced in nonlinear light+matter systems. These studies have been at the heart of what is called the ‘second’ quantum revolution. How well do we understand the process of emergence of our familiar classical world from quantum dynamics, and how close are we to realising the dream of quantum information processing?
